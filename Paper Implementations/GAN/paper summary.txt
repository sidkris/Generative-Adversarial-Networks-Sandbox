Paper summary :

GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) introduce a two-player minimax game where a generator learns to produce data from noise while a 
discriminator learns to distinguish real from fake. Training uses backpropagation (no MCMC/inference), and at equilibrium the 
generator replicates the data distribution. GANs produce competitive samples but lack explicit likelihoods and can suffer from 
mode collapse (where the generator is most likely to produce a specific subset of the full distribution).
